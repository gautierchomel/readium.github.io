The weekly Readium Engineering meetings (Wednesdays at 1530h UTC) will continue throughout the summer.  However, as many folks take vacations and are otherwise sometime too busy to attend, we may cancel any given meeting if there is insufficient attendance to warrant a meeting.

As always, you can find the link to agenda for each week's meeting on the [Readium website](https://readium.org/).
