We are happy to announce the <a href="https://www.lyrasis.org/">Lyrasis</a> is now member of the Readium Foundation. 

Lyrasis has just officially launched the mobile application of the <a href="https://thepalaceproject.org">Palace Project</a>, a nonprofit library-centered digital content platform covering the USA, with  content licensed through Palace's own marketplace as well as through most of the major library e-book vendors, including OverDrive, Baker and Taylor, Bibliotheca, and Bibliolabs.

The Palace App is available on iOS and Android, and it is based on the latest version of the open-source <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/software/readium-mobile/">Readium Mobile</a> toolkit. The Palace App will therefore benefit from the constant evolution of the best open-source reading toolkit, currently essentially developed by <a href="https://demarque.com">De Marque</a> in Canada and <a href="https://edrlab.org">EDRLab</a> in Europe: a great example of international cooperation.
