The Digital Publishing Summit Europe 2019 was held this year in Paris on June 25th and 26th, in the main building of the Bibliothèque nationale de France – site François Mitterrand (Quai François Mauriac, Paris, 13em arrondissement).

During these two days, participants did exchange on technical and business innovations in the publishing industry. Talks, panels, and lots of demos. With this event, EDRLab aims to strengthen a true spirit of cooperation between professionals and push to the massive adoption of open standards and software by the European publishing industry.
