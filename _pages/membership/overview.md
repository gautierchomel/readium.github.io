The Readium.org community is supported by organizations that join the Readium Foundation as members. Member organizations typically use Readium technologies to build solutions. You can participate in a Readium open source project or use Readium technologies without being a member, but membership is an important way to support the community.

Find out more about joining Readium Foundation [here](http://readium.org/membership/join/).

## Licensing

Effective January, 2018 all Readium SDK software is permissively licensed **free of charge** under the [3-part BSD license](https://github.com/readium/readium.github.io/blob/master/license.txt) and the previous fee-based Alternative License is no longer offered.
