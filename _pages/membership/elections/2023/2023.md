# Kate Davey (BiblioVault)

Dear Readium members, 

I’m general manager of BiblioVault, a non-profit file warehouse/delivery service/fulfillment center for scholarly books, based at the University of Chicago Press, as part of Chicago Distribution Services. Before joining BiblioVault, I was a technical manager at a division of Thomson Learning and for Harcourt Higher Ed.
 
Launched with grants from the Mellon Foundation, for the past 20 years BiblioVault (https://bibliovault.org) has helped more than 100 university and academic publishers
- inventory their electronic resources,
- make their print books into ebooks,
- move files and metadata to ebookstores and printers worldwide,
- fulfill directly to customers online, with implementations of Adobe Content Server, Readium-JS, and Readium LCP, and
- meet new ebook challenges.
 
I’m a believer in shared solutions, the energy of Readium’s contributors, and the power of sustained steady effort.
 
Best regards,<br>
Kate Davey

# Laurent Le Meur (EDRLab)

Dear Readium members, 

I'm the Director of the European Digital Reading Lab, a membership and non-profit organization dedicated to open standards, open-source and accessibility in the digital book sector. We joined the Readium Foundation in 2015 and started the developement of the new generation of Readium software, now called Readium toolkits (for Swift and Kotlin), which replaced with great success the original Readium SDK written in C. We also developed the Readium Desktop toolkit, on which our Thorium Reader application is based, and we took on the development on the open-source Readium LCP Server and associated tools. We are also financing developer support for the Readium toolkits, which is carried out by their core developers.

I strongly believe that the book sector plays an essential role in fostering freedom of expression, and that open-source software is key to a fair competition in the book market, guarantees consumer choice and cultural diversity, helps reaching a good level of interoperability of e-books across devices and is the best way to reach a high level of accessibility for people with reading disabilities. 

The Readium toolkits and Readium LCP are mightly tools for achieving this goals, that's why EDRLab is willing to continue investing in this effort for the coming years. 
 
Best regards,<br>
Laurent Le Meur
