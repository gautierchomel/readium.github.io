Dear Readium members, 
 
Over the years, I've been deeply involved with some of the key projects of the Readium Foundation: 

 - In 2014, as the IDPF rejected any further work on LCP, I took this project on and turned it into a real specification. Readium LCP is now an official ISO specification used to deliver seamlessly millions of licences all over the world. 
 - In 2016, based on earlier drafts and proof of concepts, I took the lead on the architecture of what eventually became Readium Mobile, Desktop and Web. 
 
 As the Head of Product of De Marque, I also represent an organization that has been instrumental to the success of Readium as a foundation:

- our current CTO (Jean-Philippe Bougie) created the first Readium LCP server and encryption tools written in Golang. 
 - our mobile lead (MickaÃ«l Menu) played a signicant role in improving the architecture of Readium Mobile and is currently the core maintainer of Readium Mobile for both Swift and Kotlin.
 
 As the foundation continues to evolve and extend its reach beyond EPUB, I believe that I can help in shaping up the future of Readium:

- full accessibility for any publication is finally within our reach as we're no longer blocked by third-party DRM vendors and dated reading system technologies that get in our way. As a board member, I'll dedicate my time to achieve that goal, starting with the European Accessibility directive.
 - while Readium Mobile started out with proof of concepts on the Web, Readium Web continues to lag behind what we've achieved with mobile and desktop. As a board member, I'll make sure that we bridge that gap and turn Readium into the engine that powers millions of Web Publications.
- As an organization, Readium is no longer simply an alliance between reading system vendors. As a board member, I'll make sure that we extend our reach towards other types of organizations as well, such as national and specialized libraries and beyond trade publishing.  
 
Best regards,<br>
Hadrien Gardeur<br>
Head of Product at De Marque
