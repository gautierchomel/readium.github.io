Hello Readium Foundation Board Members -

I submit myself for consideration for membership on the Readium Foundation board. I have been an ebook reader for well over a decade and I am grateful for the fundamental work this group has been doing, and I would love to help you all bring Readium into more visibility and prominence in the future.

As the Sr. Digital Product Manager for E-Reading at The New York Public Library, I recognize that we have dual responsibilities - protecting the people who use our products, and providing an accessible experience to all. Additionally, running the product side of a nationally-used open source project has given me perspective on how many unique needs must be juggled to satisfy those responsibilities. Finally, the least-known aspect of being a good open-source citizen means assisting and supporting those who donate their time to benefit both companies and people in this way. I believe I can help all of these aspects bloom brighter.

I have spent the past year becoming familiar with many aspects of this project, and am looking forward into diving more deeply into the mechanics of its progress, and helping everyone achieve their goals. If elected, I promise to devote both time and resources to move Readium forward.

Best regards,

Risa Wolf
