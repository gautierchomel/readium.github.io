Dear Readium members,

I am grateful for the opportunity to represent De Marque in applying for a seat on the Readium Foundation Board.

De Marque has been at the intersection of technology and culture from its inception, 30 years ago. In recent years, we have been a technology enabler for international publishers, retailers and public libraries, having provided countless organisations with the opportunity to share and promote their cultural assets. Early on, De Marque foresaw the potential of the Readium Foundation to create a universal ecosystem and has been an enthusiastic proponent of the foundation's endeavours. We are heavily involved in next-generation Readium projects, both as a contributor and a user, having not only one of the most widely used LCP deployments but also production applications based on the new Readium Mobile SDK.

In particular, as a software developer and now as a director of technology at De Marque, I have been able to assist with the creation of the Readium LCP specification and the creation of its first Open Source implementation. I have also been able to support and promote its benefits and use among publishers, distributors, public libraries and end-users through our various offerings.
If elected to the board, I am committed to continuing promoting Readium, its Open Source projects, and the international community that enables it all.

Jean-Philippe Bougie
